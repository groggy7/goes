// which could cause a data loss if the bus fails to publish the events after
// insertion. To prevent this, check if there exists solution specific to the
// used event store implementation. For example, the MongoDB backend provides a
// service that subscribes to MongoDB Change Streams to publish events as they
// are inserted into the database.
